Introduction
============

Statistical Energy Analysis is a method for predicting the flow of vibrational power through a structure.
SEA is used within vibroacoustics to model the flow of acoustic power through a vibrating system. 
An example is modeling the vibrations in cars due to the engine. 
SEA is generally used in the high-frequency region whereas finite-element analysis is used in the low-frequency region.

FreeCAD-SEA
===========
FreeCAD-SEA extends FreeCAD with SEA capabilities. This module provides classes and functions to perform an Statistical Energy Analysis.
SEA models can be created graphically, via the Python console or by writing Python scripts.
